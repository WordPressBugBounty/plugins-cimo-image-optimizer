== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes Cimo different from other image optimizers? =

Unlike server-side plugins, Cimo processes everything in your browser. No external APIs, no server processing, no waiting - just instant optimization as you upload.

= How will I know if it worked? =

When you upload an image into your Media Manager (let's say a .jpg), you'll notice that after uploading, it will be a .webp image! You will also find some additional information in the Media Manager about your uploaded image.

= Does Cimo work in all browsers? =

Cimo works in all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera. This currently does not work with Safari, please use one of the browsers mentioned. If you use Safari, the image will just upload as it normally would.

= Does Cimo really have no limits? =

Yes! Unlike other plugins that charge per image or have monthly quotas, Cimo's image optimization and compression is completely unlimited and free forever.

= Is my data sent to external servers? =

No! Cimo processes everything locally in your browser. Your media assets never leave your device until they're uploaded to your WordPress site, nor do they go to another server for processing.

= How does Cimo's client-side processing work? =

Our browsers right now are quite powerful and already have the capabilities for converting images to different formats.

At the very core, the conversion is done via a clever use of JavaScript's Canvas API to process your images in the browser right before they're uploaded to WordPress. 

This means faster uploads, no server load, and complete privacy.

= What image formats does Cimo support? =

Currently WebP conversion is fully supported.

= Does Cimo work with existing images? =

Currently, Cimo optimizes images during the upload process. For existing images, you can re-upload them to get the optimization benefits.

= Does Cimo convert video and audio files? =

Yes Cimo can convert video and audio files, but that's in our [premium version, check out website](https://wpcimo.com/pricing/?utm_source=plugin-directory&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=readme-txt) for more information on it.

= Will Cimo slow down my uploads? =

Actually, it speeds them up! Since images are compressed before upload, they transfer faster and take up less storage space.

= How do I access the settings page? =

Go to Settings > Cimo in your WordPress admin. There you can configure options such as WebP quality, set maximum image dimensions, control thumbnail generation, and view optimization statistics.

= What are the recommended settings? =

Click the "Recommended" button in the settings page to apply optimal settings:
- WebP Quality: 80% (best balance of quality and file size)
- Max Image Dimension: 1920px (perfect for modern web)
- Thumbnail Generation: Disabled (saves disk space)

These settings work great for most websites and provide excellent performance.

= Can I see how much storage I've saved? =

Yes! The settings page includes a statistics dashboard showing:
- Total storage saved
- Percentage reduction
- Number of media files optimized
- Original vs optimized file sizes
